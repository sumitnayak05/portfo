            <p class="h3" style="color:black"> ABOUT ROBOT </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p style="color:blue">Word robot was coined by a Czech novelist Karel Capek in a 1920 play titled Rassum’s
            Universal Robots (RUR)
            Robot in Czech is a word for  worker or servant</p>
            

          <p class="h4" style="color:black">Definition of robot:</p>
                   
           A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks: Robot Institute of America, 1979.</p>


          <blockquote>
            <p class="h3" style="color:black"> PRINCIPILE OF ROBOTICS </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p style="color:green">The word robot comes from the Czech word for forced labor, or serf. It was introduced by playwright Karel Capek, whose fictional robotic inventions were created by chemical and biological, rather than mechanical, methods. Basically a robots consists of:

          A mechanical structure, such as a wheeled platform, arm, or other construction, capable of interacting with its environment.

          Sensors to sense the environment and give useful feedback to the device.

          Systems to process sensory input in the context of the current situation and instruct the device to perform actions in response to the situation.
          

          <blockquote>
            <p class="h3" style="color:black"> MECHNACIAL STRUSTURE </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p style="color:blue">The robot structure consists basically of the robot body that includes arms and wheels. Some force such as electricity is required to make the arms and wheels turn under command. One of the most interesting aspects of robot in general is its behavior, which requires a form of intelligence.
          
          <blockquote>
            <p class="h4" style="color:black"> Motor: </p>
          </blockquote>
          

          <p>A variety of electric motors provide power to robots, making them move with various programmed motions. The efficiency rating of a motor describes how much of the electricity consumed is converted to mechanical energy.
          </p> 

          <p>
          DC motors. Permanent-magnet DC motors require only two leads, and use an arrangement of fixed- and electro-magnets (stator and rotor) and switches. These form a commutator to create motion through a spinning magnetic field.</p>
 
          <p style="color:blue">
          AC motors. These motors cycle the power at the input-leads, to continuously move the field.
          </p>

          <p>
          Stepping motors. They are like a brushless DC or AC motor. They move the rotor by applying power to different magnets in the motor in sequence (stepped). Stepping motors are designed for fine control and will not only spin on command, but can spin at any number of steps-per-second (up to their maximum speed).</p>
 
          <p>
          Servomotors. Servos are simple DC motors with gearing and a feedback control system. They adjust themselves until they match the signal. Servos are used in radio control airplanes and cars.</p>
          </p>

            <p class="h3" style="color:black"> APPLICATIONS </p>

          <p style="color:brown">

            <p style="color:red">Outer Space Applications:</p> 
             <p>Robots are playing a very important role for outer space exploration. The robotic unmanned spacecraft is used as the key of exploring the stars, planets...etc.</p>
          
            <p style="color:red"> Military Applications: </p> 
             <p>In today's modern army robotics is an important factor which is researched and developed day by day. Already remarkable success has been achieved with unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator drone, which are capable of taking surveillance photographs, and even accurately launching missiles at ground targets, without a pilot. There are many advantages in robotic technology in warfare however, as outlined by Major Kenneth Rose of the US Army's Training and Doctrine Command: ''Machines don't get tired. They don't close their eyes. They don't hide under trees when it rains and they don't talk to their buddies...A human's attention to detail on guard duty drops dramatically in the first 30 minutes ... Machines know no fear.</p>


            <p style="color:red"> Intelligent Home Applications:</p> 
             <p>We can monitor home security, environmental conditions and energy usage with intelligent robotic home systems. Door and windows can be opened automatically and appliances such as lighting and air conditioning can be pre programmed to activate. This assists occupants irrespective of their state of mobility.</p>


            <p style="color:red"> Industry:</p>
              <p>From the beginning of the industrial revolution robotics and automation becomes the most important part of manufacturing. Robotic arms which are able to perform multiple tasks such as welding, cutting, lifting, sorting and bending are used in fabrics.

              The most commonly used configurations of the industrial robots are:

              <p>Articulated Robots: An articulated robot is one which uses rotary joints to access its work space.  Articulated robots can range from simple two-jointed structures to systems with 10 or more interacting joints.The six-axis, articulated robot is the most versatile industrial robot which allows for a high level of freedom.</p>

             <p style="color:red"> Intelligent Home Applications:</p> 
             We can monitor home security, environmental conditions and energy usage with intelligent robotic home systems. Door and windows can be opened automatically and appliances such as lighting and air conditioning can be pre programmed to activate. This assists occupants irrespective of their state of mobility.
